# Broadcast

The ability to send events/status to people who you're friends with:

Like sending a "Somali society" to everyone that tagged their account with Aston university

The larger the group of people that are under the tag, the checks that will be done by our team before posting and the more it will cost the person posting.

For example,

Jeff, the head of XSOC wants to invite everyone in aston to his society event. Theres only 500 people under Aston university on the app so the check of whether or not they can post will be thorough and the fee will be larger.

However, if anna wants to post an event to everyone who has the tag "birmingham Food", they would have to pay less as only 50 people are in that tag. And the checks are not as thorough has the risk is lowered. 

## How to get a broadcasting access

1. Sign up with a regular account
2. Create and publish a event or status
3. Select broad cast to promote it
4. Select the broadcasting tags that are appropriate and within your budget

## Different from targeted advertising

Clients can pay to put adverts to everyone on the app. Use values other than tags to target users. Any tag larger than lets say 500 would require a targetd advertising fees. Basically, the clients with very large target audiences will be charged more, the advertising will be presented formally to the user and it will be promoted and supported more.
